## About Me

I'm a postdoc in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Prof. Alexis Kaminski](https://akkaminski.github.io/). I am interested in understanding and modeling fundamental aspects of multiscale environmental flows whose dynamics are controlled by buoyancy. Guided by a combination of theory, observations and numerical simulations, my work is focused on flows in the ocean interior. In particular, I think about the dynamics of stratified flows, including internal waves, instabilities and turbulence. These features exist at the smallest scales of motion in the ocean and play a crucial role in the mixing of heat, salt, nutrients and anthropogenic carbon.

Some of my current work uses data from observations of breaking internal solitary waves on the California inner shelf together with results from theory and numerics to develop improved mixing models. Before starting my postdoc in Berkeley, I was a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, graduating in July 2023. Outside of the academic world, youâ€™re most likely to find me on a bike or cooking dinner.

## Research Interests

- **stratified flows:** instabilities, internal gravity waves and turbulence
- **ocean mixing:** breaking internal waves, diagnosing and parameterising mixing efficiency
- **coastal ocean dynamics:** nonlinear internal wave dynamics, gravity currents and models of dissipation and mixing
