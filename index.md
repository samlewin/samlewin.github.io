## About Me

I'm a postdoc in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UC Berkeley, working with [Prof. Alexis Kaminski](https://akkaminski.github.io/). I am interested in understanding and modelling multiscale fluid flows in the environment. My work is guided by a combination of theory, observations and numerical simulations. I spend a lot of time thinking about the dynamics of stratified flows, including internal waves, shear flows, instabilities and turbulence. In the ocean, these features play a critical role in the transport and mixing of heat, salt, nutrients and carbon.

Previously, I was a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. You can find a list of some of my research interests and a couple of selected recent publications below. Or check out what I'm up to at the moment [here](https://samlewin.github.io/research).

## Research Interests

- **stratified and buoyancy-driven flows:** shear layers, instabilities, internal gravity waves, gravity currents and turbulence 
- **ocean mixing:** breaking internal waves, wave-mean flow interactions, diagnosing and parameterising mixing efficiency
- **coastal ocean dynamics:** shoaling nonlinear internal waves, river plumes, fronts and models of dissipation and mixing
