## About Me

I am a postdoc in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UC Berkeley with a broad interest in understanding and modeling fundamental aspects of multi-scale geophysical fluid flows, particularly in the ocean. My research lies at intersection between theory, observations and simulations of small-scale ocean dynamics. My PhD work focused on the dynamics and mixing properties of stratified turbulence using a combination of theoretical models, idealised high resolution direct numerical simulations and data-driven tools such as machine learning. I also have experience in conducting laboratory experiments for fluid dynamics, and in high performance computing.

## Research Interests

- **stratified flows:** instabilities, internal gravity waves and turbulence
- **ocean mixing:** breaking internal waves, diagnosing and parameterising mixing efficiency
- **coastal ocean dynamics:** nonlinear internal wave dynamics, gravity currents and modelling mixing and dissipation
