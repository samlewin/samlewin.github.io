## About Me

I'm a postdoc in the Mechanical Engineering Department at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Prof. Alexis Kaminski](https://akkaminski.github.io/). I am interested in understanding and modeling fundamental aspects of multiscale environmental flows whose dynamics are affected by buoyancy. My work is focused on flows in the ocean interior, guided by a combination of theory, observations and numerical simulations. In particular, I spend a lot of time thinking about the dynamics of stratified flows, including internal waves, instabilities and turbulence. All of these features exist at the smallest scales of ocean motion and play a crucial role in the mixing of heat, salt, nutrients and carbon.

Before starting my postdoc in Berkeley, I was a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, graduating in July 2023. Outside of the academic world, youâ€™re most likely to find me on a bike or cooking dinner.

## Research Interests

- **stratified flows:** instabilities, internal gravity waves and turbulence
- **ocean mixing:** breaking internal waves, diagnosing and parameterising mixing efficiency
- **coastal ocean dynamics:** nonlinear internal wave dynamics, gravity currents and models of dissipation and mixing
