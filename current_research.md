### Internal wave-mean flow interactions
#### With [Miles Couchman](https://www.yorku.ca/professor/couchman/) (York University) and Arun Balakrishna (Stanford University)

Following on from work conducted during my [PhD](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/2b1f13f0-e1a4-4ad0-bfe2-058f821689b1), many important properties of sratified turbulent mixing are sensitive to the mechanisms by which small-scale turbulence extracts kinetic and potential energy from larger-scale motions. This can lead to significant deviations away from a commonly assumed turbulent stationary state maintained by vertical shear production. Together with [Miles Couchman](https://www.yorku.ca/professor/couchman/), we are conduting direct numerical simulations to investigate the curious behaviour of internal wave packets that are refracted by, and eventually break within, a stratified horizontal shear layer. This work was initiated at the [Stanford CTR Summer Program 2024](https://ctr.stanford.edu/summer-program): check out some preliminary results in the program proceedings [here](https://web.stanford.edu/group/ctr/ctrsp24/vi09_LEWIN.pdf).
